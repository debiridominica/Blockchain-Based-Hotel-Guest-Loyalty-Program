# Blockchain-Based Hotel Guest Loyalty Program

## Overview

This project implements a decentralized loyalty program for the hospitality industry, leveraging blockchain technology to create a secure, transparent, and interoperable system for hotel guests and accommodation providers. The platform enables seamless reward earning and redemption across participating properties while maintaining guest privacy and preventing fraud.

## Core Components

The system is built around four specialized smart contracts:

1. **Property Verification Contract**: Establishes a trust framework by validating legitimate accommodation providers through a decentralized verification process.

2. **Guest Identification Contract**: Creates secure, privacy-preserving digital profiles for travelers that enable loyalty tracking without exposing personal data.

3. **Stay Tracking Contract**: Records verified hotel visits and associated spending, creating an immutable ledger of guest loyalty activity.

4. **Reward Issuance Contract**: Manages the distribution, accumulation, and redemption of loyalty points across the network of participating properties.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Property Recognition**: Earn and redeem points seamlessly across all participating hotels
- **Immutable Stay Records**: Tamper-proof history of stays and spending
- **Privacy-Preserving**: Guest data protection through cryptographic techniques
- **Fraud Prevention**: Smart contract validation prevents manipulation of loyalty points
- **Real-Time Processing**: Instant confirmation of earned points and redemptions
- **Transparent Rules**: Publicly verifiable program terms and reward calculations
- **Platform Independence**: Hotels maintain brand identity while participating in the network

## Technical Architecture

The system implements a modular design pattern:

- ERC-721 tokens for unique property verification certificates
- Zero-knowledge proofs for private guest identification
- ERC-20 compatible loyalty points with custom redemption logic
- Oracle integration for external data verification

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16.0+)
- Solidity development environment (Hardhat recommended)
- Ethereum wallet with testnet ETH
- Basic understanding of blockchain concepts

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/your-org/hotel-loyalty-blockchain.git
cd hotel-loyalty-blockchain
```

2. Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

3. Configure environment
```
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys and private keys
```

4. Compile contracts
```
npx hardhat compile
```

5. Deploy to test network
```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
```

## Usage Flow

### For Hotels

1. Apply for verification through the Property Verification Contract
2. Submit required documentation and credentials
3. Once verified, gain ability to record guest stays and issue rewards
4. Define custom reward tiers and redemption options

### For Guests

1. Create a secure digital identity through the Guest Identification Contract
2. Connect wallet to participating hotel systems during check-in
3. Automatically receive points for verified stays
4. Redeem points for room upgrades, amenities, or future stays across the network

## Development Roadmap

- **Phase 1**: Core smart contract development and testing *(Completed)*
- **Phase 2**: User interface development and hotel onboarding tools *(Current)*
- **Phase 3**: Mobile wallet integration and guest experience enhancement *(Planned)*
- **Phase 4**: Cross-chain implementation for broader network effects *(Future)*

## Security Considerations

- Regular smart contract audits by third-party security firms
- Formal verification of critical contract functions
- Rate limiting to prevent attack vectors
- Emergency pause functionality for urgent situations
